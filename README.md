The MATLAB code is mainly used for curvature segmentation (data 2) , data processing (Matlab Code), and partial data visualization (Matlab Code). 

The Python code is primarily used for interactions related to LLMs, as implementing such interactions in MATLAB is more cumbersome than in Python.

The code involves calling the original data for professional tracks. Due to restrictions in our collaboration with other organizations, we cannot provide the raw data directly. However, it is still possible to extract simulated data points from our visualization results, which do not differ significantly from the real data.
